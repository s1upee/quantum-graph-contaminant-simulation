# Quantum-Inspired Graph Simulation of Contaminant Spread

This undergraduate research project uses quantum-inspired optimization (QUBO) and graph theory to simulate the spread of contaminants across physical networks (e.g. water systems, urban layouts). The goal is to identify intervention strategies that minimize harm using constrained optimization.

## Tools & Methods
- Python, NetworkX
- QUBO formulation (via D-Wave or dimod)
- Graph simulation and visualization
- Probabilistic modeling of spread

## Project Goals
- Model contaminant flow in a network
- Apply binary optimization to block high-risk nodes
- Explore the effectiveness of different QUBO strategies

## Coming Soon
- Simulation results
- Jupyter notebooks
- SESAPS 2025 abstract
